# 8BitsMIPS
This repository contains code for a project done as a part of the course CSE590 Computer Architecture at UB.

An 8 Bits MIPS processor was built from scratch. All components were desgined using structural programming in Verilog
using Vivado IDE

The logical functioning of all the individual components were developed using behavioral programming in Verilog.
